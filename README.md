# cellular-automata
During the last term of my M.S. in Computer Science program at Johns Hopkins, I took an Independent Study course with Dr. Wiley focused on Cellular Automata (CA). We investigated a total of five CA models.
The repository contains code for those models, namely Schelling's model of segregation, BZ reaction, Gray-Scott model, SIR epidemic model with rats, lasers, and quadrature-amplitude modulation (a side project with Dr. Wiley).

# Repository layout
**QAM**: code for CA project on quadrature-amplitude modulation. The idea is to use a CA model to evolve QAM rails with optimal Gray scores. 

**lasers**: code for CA modeling of lasers dynamics.

**lib**: contains utility code as well as Hiroki Sayama's [pycxsimulator](https://github.com/hsayama/PyCX/blob/master/pycxsimulator.py).

**reaction-diffusion**: code for two reaction-diffusion models, the BZ reaction and the Gray-Scott model. Read about the Gray-Scott model [here](https://minhhua.com/ca_gray_scott/).

**schelling**: code for CA modeling of Schelling's model of segregation. Read about the model [here](https://minhhua.com/ca_schelling/).
